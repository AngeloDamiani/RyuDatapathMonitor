# RyuDatapathMonitor
A simple OpenFlow Ryu application for counters retrieval from an OpenFlow switch.

Up to now is just possible to retrieve flow stats, port stats, queue stats and queue descriptions.

This was just a little project for a university course (Modeling and Control of Communication Network) in the academic year 2017/2018.
(University of L'Aquila - IT).
