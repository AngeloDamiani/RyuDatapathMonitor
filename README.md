# RyuDatapathMonitor
A simple OpenFlow Ryu application for the counters retrieve of an OpenFlow switch.

For now is just possible to retrieve flow stats, port stats, queue stats and queue descriptions.

This was just a little project for a university course (Modeling and Control of Communication Network) in the academic year 2017/2018.
(University of L'Aquila - IT).
